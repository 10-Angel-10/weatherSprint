I made a weather app that says the weather information based on what city you type in


Peer Review: Karen Cadavos 

What you did well: 
1.you were able to implement the UI mostly and placement of the data are on point 

2. Great use of the api that uses the city as query instead of longitude and latitude so you don’t have to call another API.

What you can do better
1.When searching for a city and if the city doesn’t exists : it is also ideal to clear out the values of the forecast section

What is missing:
1. Adding of favorites functionality
